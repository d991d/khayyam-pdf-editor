                Ghiyāth al-Dīn Abu'l-Fatḥ ʿUmar ibn Ibrāhīm al-Khayyām was born around 1048 in Nishapur, a major city in the Khorasan region of Persia — present-day northeastern Iran. His family name, Khayyam (خیام), means "tent maker" in Persian, likely reflecting his family's trade.

                He lived through a remarkable era — the height of the Islamic Golden Age — when Persia was one of the world's great centres of science, philosophy, and art. He studied under the scholars of Nishapur and Samarkand, and was supported by the Seljuk sultan Malik-Shah I, who commissioned his most important scientific work.

                Khayyam died in 1131, having spent over eight decades advancing human knowledge across disciplines that most scholars would spend a lifetime mastering just one.

                Khayyam's most significant mathematical achievement was his systematic treatment of cubic equations in his Treatise on the Proofs of Algebra and Balancing (Risāla fi l-barāhīn ʿalā masāʾil al-jabr wa-l-muqābala). He classified cubic equations into fourteen categories and solved them geometrically using conic sections — intersections of circles, parabolas, and hyperbolas — centuries before algebraic solutions were found in Europe.

                He also contributed to the theory of parallel lines, anticipating ideas that would not fully emerge in the West until the 19th century with the development of non-Euclidean geometry. His work on the binomial theorem and the arithmetical triangle predates Pascal's Triangle by five centuries.

                The drafting compass in this application's icon pays direct tribute to Khayyam's geometric method of reasoning — his tools were compass and ruler, and with them he unlocked equations the ancient Greeks had left unsolved.

                In 1073, Sultan Malik-Shah I invited Khayyam to lead a group of astronomers in building a new observatory at Isfahan and reforming the Persian calendar. The result — completed in 1079 — was the Jalali calendar, named after the Sultan's title Jalāl al-Dawla.

                The Jalali calendar is extraordinarily precise: it drifts by only one day every 3,770 years, making it more accurate than the Gregorian calendar introduced five centuries later in Europe (which drifts one day every 3,226 years). It is still the basis of the official calendar of Iran and Afghanistan today.

                Khayyam's method involved measuring the solar year with meticulous astronomical observations. The bright star in the application's icon represents this legacy — the compass tip touching a star, the astronomer-mathematician measuring the heavens with geometric precision.

                Alongside his scientific work, Khayyam wrote poetry — specifically rubaiyat (رباعیات), a Persian poetic form of four-line stanzas (quatrains). He is credited with somewhere between 100 and over 1,000 quatrains, though scholars debate which were truly his.

                His poems are philosophical and often melancholy, touching on the brevity of life, the mystery of existence, and the pleasures of the present moment. They express a worldview that is sceptical of rigid religious doctrine and deeply human in its acceptance of uncertainty.

                Khayyam's poetry remained relatively obscure in the West until 1859, when the English poet Edward FitzGerald published a loose translation called The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. It became one of the most widely read poems in the Victorian era, and introduced the Western world to one of Persia's greatest minds.
